# [Nearby.Cafe](http://nearby.cafe) #

Nearby.cafe is a site I use to learn technologies. It gets the users location, and shows them the nearest cafes.

* hosted on azure
* uses cosmosDb to store the location of every cafe in the world
* cafe locations were sourced from openstreetmap
* uses react as the frontend framework
* uses asp.net and c# on the server side.
